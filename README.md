# Algorithm Visualization and Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations and visualizations of common algorithms. It is a side project focused on helping developers and students understand how these algorithms work through both code and animations. Currently, the repository includes sorting algorithms and linear search operations, with more algorithms to be added in the future.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories:

1. **Sorting Algorithms**
   - **Bubble Sort**:
     - `Bubble Sort.py`: Contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
     - `Bubble Sort Animation.py`: Provides a visual representation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in action.
   - **Insertion Sort**:
     - `Insertion Sort.py`: Contains the implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
     - `Insertion Sort Animation.py`: Provides a visual representation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in action.
   - **Selection Sort**:
     - `Selection Sort.py`: Contains the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
     - `Animated Selection Sort.py`: Provides a visual representation of the Selection Sort algorithm in action.

2. **Linear Search Operations**
   - **Maximum Finder**:
     - `Maximum Finder Linear.py`: Implements a linear search to find the maximum value in a list.
     - `Animated Maximum.py`: Visualizes the linear search process for finding the maximum value.
   - **Minimum Finder**:
     - `Minimum Finder Linear.py`: Implements a linear search to find the minimum value in a list.
     - `Animated Minimum.py`: Visualizes the linear search process for finding the minimum value.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You may also need some additional libraries for visualization, such as `matplotlib`.

### Running the Code

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualization.git
   cd algorithm-visualization
   ```

2. Run any of the algorithms directly:
   ```bash
   python3 Bubble\ Sort.py
   ```

3. To view the visualizations, run the corresponding animation scripts:
   ```bash
   python3 Bubble\ Sort\ Animation.py
   ```

### Customization

You can modify the input lists directly within the scripts to see how the algorithms perform with different datasets. Each script is designed to be easily understandable and adaptable.

## Future Work

This is an ongoing project, and more algorithms will be added in the future, including:
- Advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort and Merge Sort
- Other search algorithms
- Graph algorithms

Stay tuned for more updates!
